# By default the s2i build places the application source in /tmp/src directory. 
# This directory is where the source and other assets will be placed for the build process. 
# You can modify this location by setting the io.openshift.s2i.destination label or passing --destination flag, 
# in which case the sources will be placed in the src subdirectory of the directory you specified. 
# The destination in the above command (./) is using working directory set in the openshift/base-centos7 image, 
# which we specified in our Dockerfile, and which is set to be /opt/app-root/src.
